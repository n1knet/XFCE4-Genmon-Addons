# XFCE4 Generic Monitor Addons

Addon scripts fo the XFCE4 Generic Monitor (xfce4-genmon-plugin). These can be written in **C** or **Bash**, although in this case C has no significant speed advantage over Bash. I've written those for daily work and tested on multiple desktops and laptops.

## Installation

Obviously you will need XFCE4 and XFCE4 Generic Monitor (xfce4-genmon-plugin).  On Debian systems the plugin is in the repository: 

```sh
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install xfce4-genmon-plugin
```
